##Notes, resources, todos, and ideas


Use http://www.uroulette.com/visit for random sites, it seems better than ramdomwebsites.com.  There are many other options too.


Each level has 2x # of enemies as last level (level=# of "hyperjumps")

Put constant transparent header bar at top of each page wtih branding, level#, pause, help, and maybe a refresh (I'm stuck) buttons

Eating links turns you into 'gobble mode' to eat ghosts/enemies

One link is the escape route to 'hyperjump' to the next site
