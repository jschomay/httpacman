Hyperlink Harry, a new spin on the browser-based game

Play the in-development version at http://hyperlinkharrypoc-jschomay.rhcloud.com/play

Run around on top of random web pages. Avoid enemies. Escape through hyperlinks. Find your way back home.

The story

One day while surfing the net, Harry's modem had a power surge and sucked Harry into the web.

Now Harry's digital consciousness is lost somewhere out in hyperspace, bouncing from site to site, evading antivirus bots and seach engine spiders, and looking for his way back home.

Can you help him?

How to play

Use the keyboard arrows to move around. Collect internal links by running over them. Once you have enough "linkjuice", external links will "hyperjump" you to a new page.

WARNING: THIS IS IN ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT

Which means it is incomplete (in design and functionality) and may have some bugs and may need optimizing. Simple gameplay should work, but if you get stuck, just hit refresh (as long as you didn't somehow end up at a different site in the address bar, if so, press back).

This project is currently open source. Check out the code, comment, and fork on github.
